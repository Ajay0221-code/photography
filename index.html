            <h2>What do you need to know about event photography?</h2>
            <p>Think of events like weddings, sports, or festivals. The need to cover all your angles means teaming up with other photographers so they can be where you’re not. Event photography – Having more than one photographer allows one of you to concentrate
                on the wider scene, while the other covers moments closer to the action. Wedding photography is a specialty in photography that is primarily focused on the photography of events and activities relating to weddings. It may include other
                types of portrait photography of the couple before the official wedding day, such as a pre-wedding engagement session (photographs are later used for the couple wedding invitations). On the official wedding day, the photographer(s) will
                attempt to provide portrait photography, as well as documentary photography coverage to document the different wedding events and rituals throughout the wedding day(s).</p>
            <h2>Which is the best camera for event photography?</h2>
            <p>But the most common in event photography take place indoors in low light. This means you’ll need to carefully consider the equipment you bring with you. My experiments with simple artificial light led to my favourite portraits. I’ve never
                used professional studio lighting in my life. But I believe in the power of simple light sources. A few examples are lamps, torches, and phone screens. Regardless of their simplicity, these objects are great to add a spark to your photos.
                You can use artificial light not only for brightening your subject. It can also help you to focus better. When I take self-portraits in dark locations, I have to make sure that the autofocus feature captures the right details.Let’s have
                a look at which camera body, lenses and lighting equipment is best.</p>
